# SimpleBlackjackGame
SimpleBlackjackGame is a command-line implementation of a single-player blackjack game where the objective is to beat the dealer without exceeding a total value of 21. The player starts with 100 points, gaining 10 points for each win and losing 10 points for each loss, with the game ending when points reach zero. Cards are dealt to both the player and dealer, with the player deciding to "hit" (draw a card) or "stay" based on their hand. The dealer automatically draws cards until their total exceeds 15 or they bust. This simple and engaging game follows traditional blackjack rules and features easy-to-use commands like "hit," "stay," and "quit."
